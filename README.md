During the AI for good Hackathon 2024 at EPFL we (i.e. Guillaume Krafft, Theo Gieruc, Axel Collet, Patrick Remerscheid) prototyped a medical assistant as part of an automated, non-expert (i.e. no Radiologists or Clinicians on-site for cost reduction), decentralized imaging center network.

### Midterm vision (maybe feasible)
"Getting a medical scan as easy as getting a haircut". Imagine your routine cancer screening at a local imaging center max 40min away, as follows:

1. Walk in and get scanner assigned
2. Key personnel (e.g. nurse) does minimal preparation for scanner (security, no ferromagnetic stuff etc.)
3. Get Scanned
4. Walk out

In around 45min you are done with whatever routine check-up you wanted to do. You will instantly receive your diagnosis and any proposed follow up steps via phone, delivered via Hippo in an understandable and personal way.
The new diagnosis will be integrated and checked against your entire medical history by Hippo and counter measures to fight any upcoming symptoms can be communicated and implemented immediately in your day to day (e.g. eat more healthy, exercise more).
Any wearables that you might wear can be connected to Hippo and can help you track daily progress and vital signs etc.

### Longterm Vision (very speculative, let's go completely crazy for a minute)
"Knowing 24/7 what is going on in your body both physically and mentally" - Can Scanners get cheaper? Will there be a future with minimalistic scanners that you can wear or that everybody can have in their homes? How will medical imaging evolve? Will it stay relevant or will at some point everything be visible through blood analysis or DNA modificaitons? Can we have an agent that can track your whole life in a privacy-preserving and trustworthy way?
